# synthetic_data_generation

Synthetic data generation model using GAN

How it works:

Associative rules are used to identify key relationships in the data (e.g., between items in transactions).

GAN is trained on real data to generate synthetic transactions that preserve these associative relationships.

This is useful for creating test data or for augmenting data in machine learning tasks.
